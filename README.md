In **2000** (I still cannot find an exact date), Roy Fiedling submitted his dissertation _Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures_. It is available at <https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation.pdf>.

In **2006**, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses in the form of web services -- now commonly known as cloud computing. At that time, it was using Web Services -- hence the name -- and not REST APIs.
